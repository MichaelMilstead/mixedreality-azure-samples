<h1>Vision Treasure Hunt!</h1>
<h3>A demo Unity project that uses the MR Vision package. Works on Hololens, Android, and iOS.</h3>
This demo project is meant to show how to get camera images and send them using the VisionObject, and also to show how handle results to update your virtual objects.

Search with your device's camera for treasure! The treasure is really any class from a Custom Vision project. In my example the treasure is a coffee cup.
When you find one, cubes will launch from your location as a celebration.
